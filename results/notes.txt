z axis: (sigma=5)
base camera, 10 deg either way in x and y
z rotates n degrees in each direction. cap at 90 degrees because any larger becomes the reflected case.

range:
base camera
x, y, z rotates n times evenly to 10 degrees in each direction.

combo:
base camera, 10 deg either way in x, y, z
add some amount of cameras with (+/-10, +/-10, +/-10) orientation
